a simple game coded in lua based on the original LOZ and Binding of Isaac. If you're interesting we could use help with coding and art. Trying the game is simple by downloading this repository and the official love2d game engine

here is a link to the lua love engine for running the game: https://love2d.org/

This page describes how to run it: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started

If you want to edit the code just use any text editor. I'm using vim
