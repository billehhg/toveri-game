# toveri-game
There's not much here yet. I am learning lua with a few friends and hope to make this a long time project.

Eventually this will hopefully be a game similar to Legend of Zelda with some of the game elements like those in Binding of Isaac while still making it a game of our own.
If this sounds interesting you can check back in a few months or contact me if you like the idea and want to contribute an idea or code.
for now, if you want to try what we have, download the lua love engine and follow the directions there for opening the game in your OS
