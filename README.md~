Eventually this will hopefully be a game similar to Legend of Zelda with some of the game elements like those in Binding of Isaac while still making it a game of our own. If this sounds interesting you can check back in a few months or contact me if you like the idea and want to contribute an idea or code. For now, if you want to try what we have, download the lua love engine and follow the directions there for opening the game in your OS

here is a link to the lua love engine for running the game: https://love2d.org/

This page describes how to run it: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started

If you want to edit the code just use any text editor. I'm using vim
